# Phoenix OS
Phoenix OS is a simple CLI OS for any i386 supported CPU and should run on your average i386
# What is the strucure for code
It had 4 main folders boot for the bootloaders code then kernel for what the bootloader loads right after then drivers for
display keyboards and ports support CPU for interupts for IO to even work and a folder inside of the kernel folder commencom that contains stuff for the command line
# Why does this OS even exist
Meh just a hobby because why not mess around with a very difficult coding channleng that took many companys with over 100 people to make
in 3 years because I have access to the internet to do all of this and find freestanding code and frankinstine a custom OS
# Todo
Check the kernel.c after the includes it should have the TODO list
