# Phoenix OS
Phoenix OS is a simple CLI OS for any i386 supported CPU and should run on your average i386
# What is the strucure for code
It has four main folders: boot for the bootloader's code, kernel for the kernel, drivers for display, keyboards, and port support, CPU for interrupts for I/O.
# Why does this OS even exist
Meh just a random project because why not mess around with a very difficult coding channleng that took many companys with over 100 people to make in 3 years. After all I have access to the internet to do all of this and they did not have that and I can find the source code to windows XP on github so why not build a complex system
# Todo
Add Fat(32/16/12) Support to the OS
BASIC
Program Saving for BASIC
Saving Compiled Apps to a FS
# Archived
Pheonix-OS has been archived since most of it was buggy/did not work half of the time and took WAY to much time to develop as of 11/30/23
